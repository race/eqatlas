  <b>Project1999 Links:</b> <a href="https://wiki.project1999.com/Nagafen%27s_Lair#What.27s_in_this_zone.3F" target="_blank">(Coming Soon) What's in this zone?</a>
</p>
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Nagafen's Lair is a large set of caverns that lie deep in the Lavastorm
        Mountains. Buried deep inside these caves is the lair of the Fire Giants,
        who are the personal servants of the mighty dragon, Lord Nagafen. The
        caverns leading to the dragon are infested with all manner of bats and
        insects, as well as kobolds that have taken up residence in the entrance
        to them.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This dungeon is generally regarded as one of the two toughest dungeons
        in all of Antonica. There are many specific dangers that I will describe
        below, however there are some general dangers as well. First is that everything
        in this zone sees through invisibility, which means that corpse retrieval
        and quickly moving through the dungeon are not really possible. You will
        need to fight your way through everything you meet in order to move further
        in the dungeon.
      <p>The second general danger has to do with the physical layout of the dungeon.
        The tunnels themselves are winding and confusing, which makes getting
        lost or getting trapped in a place you don't want to be, as well as a
        quick getaway, very dangerous. There are zones to Solusek's Eye nearby
        when you are hunting kobolds, but the path to them is usually very twisty.
        There also exists within the zone a great deal of lava. People who fall
        into the lava here will take quite a bit of damage, and although there
        is usually a nearby place to exit the lava, you have to live until you
        reach it. Many longtime hunters have entire suits of protection from fire
        jewelry that they don when hunting here.
      <p>Now for specific dangers. The kobolds are probably the easiest to fight
        in the dungeon, but that's not saying much. They can hit pretty hard and
        take a lot of damage, and there are a lot of them in the outer areas,
        so it's recommended to have a group when taking them on.
      <p>The &quot;bats and bugs,&quot; as they're called, are much more dangerous.
        The bats themselves aren't too very tough, but they are nearly impossible
        to solo because of their powerful stun attack, which takes you out of
        commission for quite a while. The bugs are more dangerous, as many of
        them have some evil poison- and disease-based DoTs that can wear you out
        fast. They also tend to travel in packs and aggro easily.
      <p>Deeper still lies the Imp Guardians surrounding the Efreeti. This area
        is very dangerous to hunt in due to the pathing of the creatures, and
        has a high learning curve for how to do it safely. There is also basically
        no way to safely flee the area if you run into trouble (other than evac'ing).
        This is not an easy place to try and gain experience.
      <p>Further yet lies the Fire Giants in their temple. The strategy for clearing
        out the Fire Giants is long and detailed, and requires a highly skilled
        team of high level players to take on. None of these creatures can be
        mesmerized at all or charmed except by very high level enchanters, and
        they will resist all spells if the spellcaster is out of melee range.
        Knowing the layout of the area is also important, as you will likely aggro
        other Fire Giants through the walls of the place. Using someone who can
        feign pull is essential in this area, and it shouldn't even be attempted
        without it.
      <p>The deepest being in this zone is the mighty Lord Nagafen himself. The
        dragon lies hidden in the deepest part of the dungeon, and is protected
        by all of the creatures listed above. Taking on the dragon requires the
        coordinated efforts of several (the least I've heard of is 4) full groups
        of characters in order to take out, and even then is not something that
        it done with ease. Having that full suit of fire protection jewelry is
        only essential here if you want to live...
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>Having said all of the above, you might be wondering why people would
        fight here at all. With all of the dangers in this zone, however, come
        a great deal of both experience and items that are all highly sought after.
        Before the discovery of the lost continent of Kunark, it was actually
        difficult to find anything to kill in this zone because it was so crowded.
        It is now more open for hunters, and you can likely find great experience
        even during peak times.
      <p>There are also several areas within the dungeon where it is relatively
        safe to hunt creatures without too much danger. Most of these lie near
        the zones into Solusek's Eye, where it is possibly to pull creatures and,
        if you are overwhelmed, zone away from them. Mountains of experience can
        be earned here in a relatively short period of time by a savvy group.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom
        <font size=+2>N</font>agafen's <font size=+2>L</font>air</h3>
      <p>There are multiple entrances into Nagafen's Lair. The main one that people
        take is from the Lavastorm Mountains. Within the mountains, travel to
        the large lava pit at the north end, known as Solusek's Eye (not to be
        confused with the zone Solusek's Eye, which everyone calls Sol A). There
        are two paths to caves on the southern edge of the lava pit, the one you
        want is the western one, which will take you to Nagafen's Lair.
      <p>There are multiple zones from Solusek's Eye (Sol A) into Nagafen's Lair.
        These are frequently used as escapes from Nagafen's Lair into Sol A, but
        be aware that they are also used for the same purpose on the other side,
        and you may be going from the frying pan into the fire when you appear
        on the other side...
