      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Overthere is a vast area of plains that gradually evolves to reach
        the northern shore of the continent of Kunark. There is a vast area of
        ravines and chasms that have existed for centuries, infested with the
        evil Scorpiki, ancient protectors of the hidden temples. The evil races
        of Norrath have also claimed the shore of The Overthere and have established
        their beachhead here.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This zone is only fairly dangerous. Monsters that are weaker than you
        are generally non-aggressive, and as they get more powerful, or you move
        further south, they become much more aggressive. Sarnaks are always aggressive
        to everyone.
      <p>One place that bears special mention is the Overthere evil race outpost,
        where all Iksar and good races are KOS by some huge cliff golems and undead.
        Some agnostics from good races can travel in here with caution and deal
        with the merchants, but be sure to /con as you go. To catch the boat,
        swim from the outside of the eastern edge of the outpost. The dragoons
        from the outpost actually go on patrol around the zone during the night.
        This can be a problem to people that would normally be KOS to them, as
        you will be attacked as the dragoons make their rounds.
      <p>The other is in the chasm. The entire bottom is covered with scorpiki,
        the evil mixing of scorpions and iksar that have lived here for centuries
        beyond count. They are aggressive and powerful.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>This zone is probably the best hunting area for druids of all levels.
        The large, open spaces are almost unique on the new continent, which is
        generally very crowded with poor visibility. Also, the creatures are sparsely
        distributed, allowing you to pull and kite to your heart's content.
      <p>Also, this zone has a wide range of levels for monsters, enabling anywhere
        from 15th level to 40th level and up hunting. The region closer to the
        zone to the Frontier Mountains is quite high level, but as you go east
        and then north past the Warsliks Woods entrance, the monsters become weaker
        and can be handled by a 20th level adventurer easily.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom
        <font size=+2>T</font>he <font size=+2>O</font>verthere</h3>
      <p>The Overthere is the site of the beachhead of the evil races. This large
        structure is where the broken barge lands and disembarks for the Timorous
        Deep. The location is approximately 3000, 2000.
      <p>The Frontier Mountains can be reached through a short pass located at
        -6000, 1380. The area is notable for the large platform structure just
        north of the pass.
      <p>Warsliks Woods can be reached by a pass located high in the hills at
        approximately -240, -4390. The area is noticeable because of the large
        Iksar statue that stands in the plains straight out from this position.
      <p>The Skyfire Mountains can also be reached through the Overthere, through
        a large temple-looking structure located at -1100, 3900.
      <p>Howling Stones can be found by zoning to it through The Overthere. The
        location of the entrance is in a chasm with a large number of scorpiki.
        There is a glowing red sphere that is locked, and nobody seems to know
        where to find the key...
